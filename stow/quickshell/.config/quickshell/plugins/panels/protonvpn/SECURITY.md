## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository:

**https://github.com/grichard99/omaproton-vpn/security/advisories/new**

It goes only to the maintainer. Please include what you found, how to
reproduce it, and what you think the impact is. You'll get a reply, and
credit in the fix if you want it.

Please don't open a public issue for anything that could expose a user's
traffic, credentials, or session.

## What this widget does and doesn't do

Short version — the long one is in the README's *Security and privacy*
section:

- Stores no credentials, tokens, or account data. Sign-in goes to the
  Proton CLI's own prompt in a terminal; the widget never sees the password
  or 2FA code.
- Makes no network requests of its own. The world map is drawn from bundled
  data and the Proton client's own cache.
- Never uses `sudo`. The CLI install goes through Omarchy's installer, which
  owns the password prompt in a terminal.
- Runs every command as an argument list, never through a shell, except the
  username handed to Omarchy's terminal launcher — which is allow-listed and
  quoted first.
- Writes one file of its own (`~/.local/state/omarchy-protonvpn/state.json`).

## Trust boundary

Like every Omarchy plugin, this runs unsandboxed as your user. It is not a
defence against root, against a compromised shell, or against other software
running as you. Its job is to never make that boundary worse.

## Single-author policy

Only the maintainer commits to this repository. Pull requests are closed
rather than merged, as a defence against the AI-generated and supply-chain
pull requests that public projects now attract; findings in them are re-filed
as issues and credited. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
